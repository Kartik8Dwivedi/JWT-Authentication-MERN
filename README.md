## Introduction
In this repository, you'll find a fully functional JWT-based authentication system that includes both the frontend and backend components. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a widely-used standard for securely transmitting information between parties, making it an excellent choice for handling user authentication in web applications.

The frontend of the application is built using React, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface for user registration, login, and access to protected routes. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, ensuring robust and efficient handling of authentication requests, user management, and JWT generation/validation.

## Features
- User registration with secure password hashing
- User login and access to protected routes using JWT
- Automatic token refresh for seamless user experience
- Error handling and validation for input forms
- Scalable and well-organized codebase
- Customizable and extensible for future improvements
